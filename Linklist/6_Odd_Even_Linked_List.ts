/**
328.Odd Even Linked List

Medium

--> Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.
--> The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.
--> Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
--> You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]

Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range [0, 10^4].
-10^6 <= Node.val <= 10^6
